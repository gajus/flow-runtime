Whoever\n * instantiates a transaction can provide enforcers of the invariants at\n * creation time. The `Transaction` class itself will supply one additional\n * automatic invariant for you - the invariant that any transaction instance\n * should not be run while it is already being run. You would typically create a\n * single instance of a `Transaction` for reuse multiple times, that potentially\n * is used to wrap several different methods. Wrappers are extremely simple -\n * they only require implementing two methods.\n *\n * <pre>\n *                       wrappers (injected at creation time)\n *                                      +        +\n *                                      |        |\n *                    +-----------------|--------|--------------+\n *                    |                 v        |              |\n *                    |      +---------------+   |              |\n *                    |   +--|    wrapper1   |---|----+         |\n *                    |   |  +---------------+   v    |         |\n *                    |   |          +-------------+  |         |\n *                    |   |     +----|   wrapper2  |--------+   |\n *                    |   |     |    +-------------+  |     |   |\n *                    |   |     |                     |     |   |\n *                    |   v     v                     v     v   | wrapper\n *                    | +---+ +---+   +---------+   +---+ +---+ | invariants\n * perform(anyMethod) | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | | maintained\n * +----------------->|-|---|-|---|-->|anyMethod|---|---|-|---|-|-------->\n *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n *                    | |   | |   |   |         |   |   | |   | |\n *                    | +---+ +---+   +---------+   +---+ +---+ |\n *                    |  initialize                    close    |\n *                    +-----------------------------------------+\n * </pre>\n *\n * Use cases:\n * - Preserving the input selection ranges before/after reconciliation.\n *   Restoring selection even in the event of an unexpected error.\n * - Deactivating events while rearranging the DOM, preventing blurs/focuses,\n *   while guaranteeing that afterwards, the event system is reactivated.\n * - Flushing a queue of collected DOM mutations to the main UI thread after a\n *   reconciliation takes place in a worker thread.\n * - Invoking any collected `componentDidUpdate` callbacks after rendering new\n *   content.\n * - (Future use case): Wrapping particular flushes of the `ReactWorker` queue\n *   to preserve the `scrollTop` (an automatic scroll aware DOM).\n * - (Future use case): Layout calculations before and after DOM updates.\n *\n * Transactional plugin API:\n * - A module that has an `initialize` method that returns any precomputation.\n * - and a `close` method that accepts the precomputation. `close` is invoked\n *   when the wrapped process is completed, or has failed.\n *\n * @param {Array<TransactionalWrapper>} transactionWrapper Wrapper modules\n * that implement `initialize` and `close`.\n * @return {Transaction} Single transaction for reuse in thread.\n *\n * @class Transaction\n */\nvar TransactionImpl = {\n  /**\n   * Sets up this instance so that it is prepared for collecting metrics.

By design, Flow runs at <em>compile time</em>, and so it can only verify code and data that it can actually see and understand.</p>\n              <p>\n                Every time control passes to untyped code (via a call to a library function, for example), Flow has to bail out, and assign the type <code>any</code> to the value, which means that any subsequent checks against this value will silently pass, even if it's completely wrong - it's unsound.\n                When first introducing Flow to an existing codebase this unsoundness can be everywhere. Even if you explicitly annotate the result of every call into untyped code, there's no way for Flow to validate that your assumption is correct.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                When combined with <Link to=\"/babel-plugin-flow-runtime\">a babel plugin</Link>, <code>flow-runtime</code> can fill in this gap. The babel plugin takes the Flow annotations you're writing anyway, and compiles them into <code>flow-runtime</code> calls and declarations. Now every annotation will be checked at runtime, which is especially useful during development. It does incur a performance hit though, so it's often sensible to turn off <code>assertion</code> mode in production, leaving type declarations intact but eliminating the associated overhead.\n              </p>\n              <Link to=\"/try\">You can try out the babel plugin in your browser</Link>\n              <hr />\n              <h4>What about TypeScript?</h4>\n              <p>Despite the name, it's absolutely possible to use <code>flow-runtime</code> with TypeScript. Unfortunately it's not yet possible to leverage the TypeScript annotations themselves, but all of the library methods should match the relevent TypeScript semantics as Flow and TypeScript are both
