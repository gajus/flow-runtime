By design, Flow runs at <em>compile time</em>, and so it can only verify code and data that it can actually see and understand.</p>\n              <p>\n                Every time control passes to untyped code (via a call to a library function, for example), Flow has to bail out, and assign the type <code>any</code> to the value, which means that any subsequent checks against this value will silently pass, even if it's completely wrong - it's unsound.\n                When first introducing Flow to an existing codebase this unsoundness can be everywhere. Even if you explicitly annotate the result of every call into untyped code, there's no way for Flow to validate that your assumption is correct.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                When combined with <Link to=\"/babel-plugin-flow-runtime\">a babel plugin</Link>, <code>flow-runtime</code> can fill in this gap. The babel plugin takes the Flow annotations you're writing anyway, and compiles them into <code>flow-runtime</code> calls and declarations. Now every annotation will be checked at runtime, which is especially useful during development. It does incur a performance hit though, so it's often sensible to turn off <code>assertion</code> mode in production, leaving type declarations intact but eliminating the associated overhead.\n              </p>\n              <Link to=\"/try\">You can try out the babel plugin in your browser</Link>\n              <hr />\n              <h4>What about TypeScript?</h4>\n              <p>Despite the name, it's absolutely possible to use <code>flow-runtime</code> with TypeScript. Unfortunately it's not yet possible to leverage the TypeScript annotations themselves, but all of the library methods should match the relevant TypeScript semantics as Flow and TypeScript are both

The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\n * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the\n * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent\n * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\n * invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      maxWait,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxing = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n    maxWait = maxing ?
